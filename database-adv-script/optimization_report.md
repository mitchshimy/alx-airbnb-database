### üîç Key Observations

- **Full table scans on `properties`, `bookings`, and `payments`:**  
  The query is scanning the entire tables, indicating that indexes are not being utilized effectively. This becomes a performance issue as data volume increases.

- **Possible indexes not used:**  
  Although `possible_keys` include helpful indexes for `bookings` and `payments`, MySQL did not use them (`key: null`). This may be due to outdated statistics or insufficient selectivity of the indexed columns.

- **Efficient use of primary key for `users`:**  
  The `users` table is accessed using an `eq_ref` join with the primary key, which is optimal.

- **Join buffer with hash join:**  
  The `Extra` field for `bookings` and `payments` mentions `"Using join buffer (hash join)"`. This means MySQL is using a hash join strategy in memory, which is generally less efficient than indexed joins.
